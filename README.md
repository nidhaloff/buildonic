# buildonic

A lightweight interactive CLI package to easily build ionic apps using one command

> **_NOTE:_**  buildonic is still under heavy development.

## Installation

using npm: `npm i -g buildonic`

using yarn: `yarn add -g buildonic`

 > **_NOTE:_**  You may need to use `sudo` if you are on linux.
 
## Why?

Because building ionic apps for mobile is a pain (at least that's my experience)

I spent a lot of time googeling and asking in the ionic forum before I could build my app and make it ready for appstore. Therefore I decided to create this simple tool.


## Usage

Just run `buildonic run` inside your ionic project. Have fun ;)
